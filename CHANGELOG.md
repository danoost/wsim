# Change History for rexsim

## r21

* Various changes to reflect the Basys implementation of WRAMP. This includes visuals and the specifications of the board: clock rate, amount of RAM, new parallel controls, etc.
* Bump version to 3.0.0
* Update WRAMPmon to version 0.7
* Fix the warnings that were generated by xbuild
* Annotations including Address Bus, Program Counter, and Interrupts have been moved underneath the picture of the board. The new board does not have physical lights for interrupts.
* BUGFIX: Each component now only resets once when the program starts.
* BUGFIX: Reset button no longer clobbers RAM while WRAMPmon init is still running - The CPU tick thread now pauses while a reset operation is underway.
* BUGFIX: Revert change in r17 to correctly *not* throw a GPF when the KU bit of $cctrl is set to zero from kernel mode.
* BUGFIX: GPFs and arithmetic exceptions are thrown correctly, rather than crashing the program.
* BUGFIX: The "set character position" escape sequence (\033[yy;xxH) is now correctly interpreted as a 1-indexed value rather than a 0-indexed value.

## r20

* Update to version 2.0 with Virtual Memory and Protection
* BUGFIX: Combining digits on the seven-segment displays was incorrectly using all bits in the registers when SSD-Decoding was enabled.
* BUGFIX: Program Counter was not constrained to 20 bits
* FEATURE: Added support for virtual memory and protection in user mode
* Undocumented: Fixes the bug present in r19 which makes rfe leave the KU bit set to 1.

## r19

* Enhancement: "fat finger" interface for pressing both parallel buttons at the same time by clicking between them.

## r18

* Fixed warnings
* Updated version number to 1.5

## r17

* Option to override disassembly formatting
* Updated to match what appears to be a bug in the physical WRAMP processor: explicitly setting the KU bit of $cctrl to zero, while in kernel mode, results in the value being changed successfully but also triggers a GPF
* Updated bootloader image version to 0.6
* Updated to .net 4.5

## r16

* BUGFIX: Interrupt acknowledgement was ignored in parallel and serial IO devices

## r15

* BUGFIX: negative address offsets were being handled incorrectly
* BUGFIX: values larger than one byte were not being correctly masked in the serial device

## r14

* Updated version numbers to 1.2

## r13

* BUGFIX: Simulator allowed writes to readonly register $0

## r12

* Fixed version numbers

## r11

* Updated version number

## r10

* Removed unnecessary code from the timer device
* Fixed timer behaviour: now correctly copies Load to Count when enabling the timer
* Updated to v1.0.0.1

## r9

* Added breakpoints (accessible through the Memory (RAM) form).

## r8

* Backtracked to .net 3.5 for compatibility with mono

## r7

* Added option to toggle CPU throttling

## r6

* BUGFIX: negative immediate values are now sign-extended appropriately.
* BUGFIX: BasicSerialPortForm now displays an error when receiving an unsupported ASCII escape sequence, rather than crashing.
* FEATURE: Single-stepping code, pausing execution

## r5

* Changed target to Any CPU

## r4

* The proper initial commit...

## r3

* Removed initial commit, since it was empty...
